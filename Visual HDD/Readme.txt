How to use VisualHDD
Firstly, run the VisualHDD executable. Once running the initial window(Fig1) of VisualHDD will appear. 
VisualHDD will, prior to the initial window display, scan the system's storage devices and display an appropriate pie chart of allocated disk space usage of those drives in particular.
All pie chart weights are measured by the amount of space each file/folder/drive occupies, with respect to the total space occupied by all files/folders/drives.

A drive must then be selected, by clicking on the appropriate drive button(eg. D:/), and clicking the scan button(highlighted in green). Once scanned another appropriate pie chart is displayed of the selected drive's containing files and folders.
Each scan can be re-initialized, or stopped by clicking:
'File' -> 'Scan' or 'Stop Scan'

Each slice of the pie chart can be clicked(left mouse click) on to view a display of the selected slice as a pie chart on its own. However, this function is only applicable to slices that represent folders, if a slice is clicked on that is not a folder, and appropriate message is displayed. This functionality is also applicable to folders within the selected folder.
